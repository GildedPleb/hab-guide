# Support

Bitcoiners,

Gilded Pleb here, I have been involved in Bitcoin for a long time, but with a
strong preference for remaining private, so this is my semi-public debut on a
new yet pseudonymous account, pleasure to make your acquaintance!

I have wanted to work on, in, or around Bitcoin for years now. However, my love
of and deep respect for Bitcoin as well as my atypical background, have, for a
long time, caused me to stop and say, "Sure, but how to break into that space,
what can I bring to the table?"

In pursuit of that end, in 2018, I learned to code. But that alone shouldn't be
enough. So, in 2019-2022, I worked as a Full Stack developer at a transportation
startup— getting professional experience in everything from actual hardware, to
CSS animations. Nearing the end of that incredible experience, I felt like I
could finally bring something to the table.

I put together a portfolio project to show off my skills, and this HAB Node and
guide was the result: hardware, DevOps, FrontEnd, and even animation in the
introduction page. I am very please with how this all turned out, only wishing
that I could have incorporated a DB to show of backend skills as well.
Certainly, it seems that this project may be bigger than my desire to get a job,
so I really can not complain.

Though it is a work in progress, I hope that for some of you, a HAB Node is a
net addition to the space, and pushes the conversation forward about creating
nodes which can truly support the entire spectrum of peer-to-peer and
distributed infrastructure in very reliable, private, affordable, non-relay,
non-federated, and sovereign ways for everyone. Indeed, Plebs should be able to
put the entire internet on our shoulders, and this is how it starts.

By browsing this site, and hopefully being intrigued or challenged by these
ideas—even if you disagree, you have helped this project be better, thank you
for the support.

Thank you!

There is much more to come, and Bitcoin is only getting started,

Sincerely,

— Gilded Pleb

A few notes on additional support for this project.

In addition to reading about this project, there are a few other ways you can
show support if you are so inclined:

- Follow me on Twitter `@gildedpleb` say hi and let's have a conversation! Or,
  gildedpleb at protonmail.
- Share links to this website on the platforms of your choice.
- Watch, star, and contribute to these projects on GitHub: the
  [Helm Chart](https://github.com/GildedPleb/helm-charts/blob/master/charts/hab),
  [Ansible Playbooks](https://github.com/GildedPleb/hab-plays), and the
  [Guide](https://github.com/GildedPleb/hab-guide). There is much we still need
  to learn and many problems yet to solve.
- **Importantly**, for this project to continue, it needs people to build HAB
  nodes, document the progress, tinker, write issues/PRs and collaborate. There
  are a million ways to skin this cat, let's start figuring out the best ones.
- If your preferred way of contributing to Bitcoin is incubating startups,
  funding companies, or investing in entrepreneurs, lets talk. If it's not
  obvious, there are a handful of startups and business opportunities concealed
  in these pages which can materially improve the lives of Bitcoiners.
- Directly funding via grants, donations, or other voluntary avenues is also an
  option. Get in touch for a bitcoin address, and information on how said
  capital might be deployed.
- Lastly, and _perhaps most pressingly_, this started as a portfolio project for
  a reason: to be an attractive candidate for a job in Bitcoin. It turned into
  something else, clearly, but I am still very keen on staying humble and
  stacking sats. Let's talk if you have an open position for a Full Stack
  Engineer in Bitcoin _only_. If you have already posted jobs that appear to me
  to fit the bill, expect my application!
