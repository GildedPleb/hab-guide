title: Support the HAB Node project

# Support

Bitcoiners,

Gilded Pleb here, pleasure to make your acquaintance.

I have wanted to work on, in, or around Bitcoin for a long time. However, my
love and deep respect of Bitcoin as well as my atypical background, have, for
years, caused me to stop and say "Sure, but how to break into that space, what
can I bring to the table?"

In pursuit of that end, in 2018, I learned to code. But that alone shouldn't be
enough. So, in 2019-2022, I worked as a Full Stack developer at a transportation
startup— professionally getting experience in everything from actual hardware,
to CSS animations. Nearing the end of that incredible experience, I felt like I
could finally bring something to the table.

I put together a portfolio project to show off my skills, and this HAB Node and
guide was the result: from the CSS animated introduction, to the bloody fingers
working on HAB Node hardware, and everything in between.

Though it is certainly a work in progress, I hope that for some of you, it is a
net addition to the space, and pushes the conversation forward about creating
nodes which can truly support the entire spectrum of peer-to-peer and
distributed infrastructure in very reliable, affordable, non-relay, and
non-federated ways for everyone. Indeed, Plebs should be able to put the entire
internet on our shoulders, and this is how it starts.

By browsing this site, and hopefully being intrigued or challenged by these
ideas, you have supported this project.

There is much more to come, and Bitcoin is only getting started,

Thank you!

— Gilded Pleb

A few notes on additional support for this project.

In addition to reading about this project, there are a few other ways you can
show support if you are so inclined:

- Follow us on Twitter `@gildedpleb` say hi and let's have a conversation! Or,
  email us at gildedpleb at protonmail.
- Share links to this website on the platforms of your choice.
- Watch, star, and contribute to these projects on GitHub: the
  [Helm Chart](https://github.com/GildedPleb/helm-charts/blob/master/charts/hab),
  [Ansible Playbooks](https://github.com/GildedPleb/hab-plays), and the
  [Guide](https://github.com/GildedPleb/hab-guide). There is much we still need
  to learn and many problems yet to solve.
- **Importantly**, for this project to continue, it needs people to build HAB
  nodes, document the progress, tinker, write issues/PRs and collaborate. There
  are a million ways to skin this cat, let's start figuring out the best ones.
- If your preferred way of contributing to Bitcoin is incubating startups,
  funding companies, or investing in entrepreneurs, lets talk. If it's not
  obvious, there are a handful of startups and business opportunities concealed
  in these pages.
- Directly funding via grants, donations, or other voluntary avenues is also an
  option. Get in touch for a bitcoin address, and information on how said
  capital might be deployed.
- Lastly, and _perhaps most pressingly_, this started as a portfolio project for
  a reason: to be an attractive candidate for a job in Bitcoin. It turned into
  something else, clearly, but I am still very keen on staying humble and
  stacking sats. Let's talk if you have an open position for a Full Stack
  Engineer in Bitcoin only.
