# Stand-up Vanilla

Now, let's finally get Kubernetes up and running.

## K3s

Let's inspect `K3s/standup-vanilla.yml`:

1. The first thing we will do is a get a script from `https://get.k3s.io/` that
   installs K3s, from the official k3s distribution source. If you would like to
   view that script, and you should, open up the link in a web browser.
1. Then we are going to create and save a server token which is used by our
   hosts to identify and join the cluster.
1. Then we are going to install k3s using the token on our Leader, followed by
   Lieutenants, followed by Workers.
1. Once the worker hosts are ready, we will transfer the cluster credentials to
   the control computer giving us access to the cluster.

```bash
apb K3s/standup-vanilla.yml
```

It may take a few minutes, so give it some time.

To confirm that everything is up and running, on your control machine run:

```bash
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

And you should see something like this:

```bash
% kubectl get nodes -o wide

```

You are now the proud owner of a Kubernetes Clusterâ€”Yet another Pleb is the
server farm now.

## Add New Vanilla Hosts

If needed, we now have the ability to bring a new vanilla host into the cluster,
which has been added to the host plan, with a one-liner command, without tearing
down or setting up anything but that host:

```bash
apb Hosts/standup-live.yml -e "plan=host-plan-2022-03-17" && apb K3s/standup-vanilla.yml
```

Now that we are up and running, let's investigate how to tear it down.
