# Congratulations, You Are Now A Gilded Pleb!

You now have a HAB Node. You have eliminated many single points of failure for
your node, meaning it will be more reliable to Bitcoin and all higher layers
will be more reliable to you. This is the way, and you have walked it.

You are well on your way to becoming a true, First Class Citizen in the new
bitcoin-centric economy.

Again, Congratulations!
