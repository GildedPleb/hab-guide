# Stand-up Vanilla Hosts

We will now be standing up Vanilla Hosts.

For each host type below, you will have to do a handful of particulars before
standing up the vanilla host. However, once those are complete, you will be
running _the same_ command on your control computer with different arguments.
Something like:

```bash
apb Hosts/standup-vanilla.yml -e "rawhosts=hostName"
```

Before you set up your hosts as per their type, and before you run any commands,
let's review the final code block we will be running. Open up
`Hosts/standup-vanilla.yml` in an editor. This time, see if you can figure out
what it's doing without heavily commented code. We suggest DuckDuckGoing
anything you do not understand with a simple copy/past. However, if that is too
in the weeds, we have heavily commented the Ansible plays for
`Hosts/prep-raw-pis-for-boot-from-usb.yml` open that file to get a better
rundown of Ansible files.

But, to broadly explain the `Hosts/standup-vanilla.yml` code that we will run
for all hosts, the commands will do this:

1. Add a handful of files to the `~/.HAB/inventory` directory that will assist
   in planing and managing the cluster for later steps.
1. Fact gather about the new hosts added in the command line, and add then to
   any previously added hosts.
1. Check for host name validity and uniqueness.
1. Make sure, according to OS, that the host is up-to-date, and the appropriate
   settings are set for being able to receive k3s.
1. Also add some important quality of life improvements, like message-of-the-day
   when you ssh into a host.
1. Assert and double check everything looks good to go.

With this in mind, let's now prep your hosts according to the type of host they
are.

## Stand-up Vanilla RPi

Raspberry Pi's need no introduction. At this point in time, we should probably
assume a great deal of pleb-nodes run on Raspberry Pis and much of the following
should be familiar to all who run them.

## Boot From SSD

Running k3s in high availability mode‚Äîwhere there are three or more controlling
nodes that can individually be killed without the cluster going down‚Äîmay kill
your SD card from too many etcd writes, and besides, your SD card read/write
times are very slow in comparison to what is available. The
[docs](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/ha-embedded/) suggest
that running k3s in HA on a SD card is not a good idea. We could run the DB
externally, and have 2 master nodes, but that feels antithetical‚Äîwe'd rather
have a third node to run in HA mode than a NFS external database managing node
state‚Äîas said NFS may not be able to function as a full node itself.

In light of this, we will provision our pi's to boot from a SSD card connected
to USB.

## Prep Raw Raspberry Pi's

:::warning

Be sure all hosts and all SD/SSD media do not have any information on them that
is not backed up or can not be lost. _Imaging will erase this information._

:::

The purpose of this first official imaging is to gather data about our pis, to
`ssh` in for the first time, and to make sure they are ready to boot from an
external SSD. Only once they are ready to boot from an external drive, will we
be able to stand up vanilla pis.

A few notes to keep in mind before embarking:

- **Host Count**: If you only have one pi, that's fine.
- **SD Count**: If you only have 1 SD card but multiple pis, you will have to
  run through this entire thing for each pi, individually, but it'll work.
- **Add a Pi Later**: You must also go through these steps to add a new pi,
  regardless of the state of other pis (when adding a new pi, you only have to
  execute all actions against the one new pi, the other pis are golden)
- **User/Password**: This guide and the Ansible scripts herein rely on a uniform
  user/password schema when in the raw and vanilla state. Though you can deviate
  from them, it will make your life just a little easier to stick with the same
  user and password for ALL hosts in the vanilla state. We will secure the host
  with far superior methods later on.

  :::warning

  With the first Pi imaging, it is important to stick with the given name and
  password. These are explicitly tied to a script and only used one time as such
  for the first imaging. Then you can change them.

  :::

- **Booting From USB**: The
  [recommended way of ensuring that booting from USB is enabled](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#raspberry-pi-4-boot-eeprom)
  is simpler. However, this way will provide some more logging if things go
  south and will update firmware if needed.

### First Imaging

1.  If you are setting up multiple pis, none of the params in the below list
    will change pi to pi, thus, setting `to always use` means you do not have to
    do this for each image write when completed in parallel. Or if you only have
    1 SD card, you can write one image and start at **Step vii** for each
    additional pi in **This Step**. In such a case, be sure to continue to
    **Step 2** and **3**, before moving on to the next pi. Repeat for each
    Raspberry Pi:
    1.  Insert SD card into control computer
    1.  In Raspberry Pi Imager, choose image: `Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)`
    1.  Select appropriate SD card
    1.  Click the ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Options:
        - Image customization options: `to alwasy use`
        - ‚úÖ Enable SSH
          - ‚úÖ User password authentication
        - ‚úÖ Set username and password
        - Username: `pi`
        - Password: `raspberryRaw`
        - ‚úÖ Set locale setting
          - Time zone: `[your timezone]`
          - Keyboard layout: `[your keyboard layout]`
          - ‚úÖ Skip first-run wizard
          - If you are using wifi for this (not officially recommended, but
            doable), you should set that up here
    1.  **WRITE THE IMAGE**
    1.  Eject
    1.  Put into appropriate RPi
    1.  Attach pi to the network via Ethernet if you are using Ethernet
    1.  Power on (aka, plug into power)
1.  Once all the pis are powered on (or once each pi is individually if you only
    have 1 SD card), run this command on your local computer, alter the subnet
    to the subnet your pis are on, it can be CIDR, a range, or a single IP‚Äî(it
    gets past to `nmap` in the play). Again, use the method we discussed in
    [Ansible](/docs/l1-hosts/ansible) and review the code you are about to run
    before running, we have heavily commented it to help.

    ```bahs
    apb Hosts/prep-raw-pis-for-boot-from-usb.yml -e "subnet=10.1.0.20-29"
    ```

    If all is well, Ansible will update the software, ensure that booting from
    USB is enabled, update firmware, log pertinent info, and shut down ALL the
    pis. If something fails, consult the Ansible logs and trouble shoot any
    issues.

1.  Once all the pis are shut down, remove the SD Card(s).

You should never have to do this step again for any pi that has already done it.
But it's idempotent, so it doesn't matter if you do just to make sure‚Äîand thus
the power of idempotence.

You can now boot from a USB attached drive, so, let's do that...

### Second Imaging

1. Open Raspberry Pi Imager once again on control computer:
1. This time, for each RPi:
   - Insert **SSD** (not to be confused with SD Card) into the control computer.
   - Choose image: `Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)`
   - Select appropriate SSD
   - Click the ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Options. If you are setting up multiple pis, the only
     param of the bellow settings that will change pi to pi is the hostname
     - Image customization options: `to always use`
     - ‚úÖ Set the hostname. Use the hostname that is already defined in DHCP/DNS
       for the device the SSD belongs to: e.g. `pi1`.
     - ‚úÖ Enable SSH
       - ‚úÖ User password authentication
     - ‚úÖ Set username and password (This password can be altered, but its just
       easier keep it as is. If you alter them, they must stay uniform across
       hosts)
       - Username: `hab`
       - Password: `vanillaHab`
     - ‚úÖ Set locale setting
       - Time zone: `[your timezone]`
       - Keyboard layout: `[your keyboard layout]`
       - ‚úÖ Skip first-run wizard
   - **WRITE THE IMAGE**
1. Eject
1. Put SSD into appropriate RPi
1. Power on

If you didn't change the user/password, on the control machine, edit the host
names below and run:

```bash
apb Hosts/standup-vanilla.yml -e "rawhosts=pi1,pi2,pi3,pi4,pi5"
```

If you did change the user and password, edit the host names, user, and password
below and run:

```bash
apb Hosts/standup-vanilla.yml -e "rawhosts=pi1,pi2,pi3,pi4,pi5 user=pi pass=raspberryRaw"
```

If there are no failures, all raw pi's are now vanilla hosts üôå

## Stand-up Vanilla NUCs

NUCs are extremely performant, low form-factor, extensible consumer grade
devices but can be more expensive than pis.

## Prep Raw NUCs

- **User/Password**: This guide and the Ansible scripts herein rely on a uniform
  user/password schema when in the raw and vanilla state. Though you can deviate
  from them, it will make your life just a little easier to stick with the same
  user and password for ALL hosts in the vanilla state. We will secure the host
  with far superior methods later on.

:::warning

Be sure all hosts and all SD/SSD media do not have any information on them that
is not backed up or can not be lost. _Imaging will erase this information._

:::

1. Install all the hardware on the NUC: M.2 drive, SATA, RAM, etc.
1. Connect monitor and keyboard to NUC.
1. Connect Ethernet cable.
1. Connect power, but no need to power on yet.
1. Get the latest Ubuntu server image from
   [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/server) on your controlling computer
1. On the Ubuntu website, select "Option 2 - Manual Server Installation"
1. Make sure you are downloading **AMD** architecture (you usually are, and it
   will say so in the name of the download, e.g.
   "ubuntu-20.04.4-live-server-amd64.iso")
1. Click download
1. Open the Raspberry Pi Imager
1. Choose "Use Custom" and find the image you just downloaded
1. Insert a SD card into the control computer
1. Select it in Imager as the "storage" option
1. (it may ask you if you would like to preserver setting from the previous
   imaging, click "Use Defaults" or "Reset")
1. **Click WRITE**
1. Once written, Eject card and put it in the NUC
1. Power on the NUC and hold / press F10 on the keyboard until you see the
   `boot from` screen.
1. Select boot from USB / SD.
1. Go through the process of setting up the server.
   - Almost all the setting defaults should suffice
   - No need to enter your name
   - User and password (This password can be altered, but again it's just easier
     to keep it as is):
     - User: `hab`
     - Password: `vanillaHab`
   - SSH:
     - Make sure it is installed
     - No need to copy over keys just yet
     - Make sure password authentication is enabled
   - Select disk partitions and boot drives as you find appropriate, generally,
     we want at least one massive partition > 1.5 TB. (If this step confuses
     you, just select defaults, it can be fixed later).
1. Once everything is installed, it will indicate a successful install, and ask
   you to eject the USB / SD media, and hit `enter`, Eject it, hit enter.
1. It will now Boot the device from disk
1. Log in using provided user/pass
1. Do not disconnect keyboard / monitor until you can confirm that you can ssh
   in from local control machine using user/pass given above
   - If you can not log in, you may need to start `sshd` on the NUC, run:
     `sudo systemctl enable sshd` (this is a problem we had) but there could be
     a
     [handful](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=can+not+SSH+into+Ubuntu+Server+on+NUC&t=ffab&ia=web)
     of other things going on.)
1. Once you have SSHed in, escalate the `hab` user permissions to use sudo
   without a password
   1. Run:
      ```bash
      sudo visudo
      ```
   1. Add this to the end of the file:
      ```bash
      hab ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
      ```
   1. To save changes: `CTRL + o`
   1. Confirm changes: `ENTER`
   1. Exit and apply : `CTRL + x`
1. Set the host name
   1. A hostname will never change from top to bottom in this guide for each
      computer. Use the hostname that is already defined for this device: e.g.
      `nuc1`
   1. While still logged in, run this command, be sure to change the name to
      match the NUC its being applied to, e.g. `nuc1` etc:
      ```bash
      sudo hostnamectl set-hostname nuc1
      ```
1. It might also be good to make sure firmware is up-to-date with:
   `fwupdmgr get-updates --ipfs` (though, we have only had limited success
   here).
1. Additionally, it's probably a good idea to make sure your hard drive, volume
   groups, and logical volumes are in order. Run, `sudo pvs` `sudo vgs` and
   `sudo lvs`. Your physical volumes ('pv', from 'pvs') should reflect the
   expected disk space you have. So too should vgs (volume groups) and lvs
   (logic volumes). See
   [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1106795/ubuntu-server-18-04-lvm-out-of-space-with-improper-default-partitioning)
   for more details, but you might need to simply run `lvm` `lvextend` and
   `resize2fs`:
   ```
   hab@nuc2: sudo su -
   [sudo] password for hab:
   root@nuc2:~# lvm
   lvm> lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
     Size of logical volume ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv changed from 100.00 GiB (25600 extents) to <1.82 TiB (476150 extents).
     Logical volume ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv successfully resized.
   lvm> exit
     Exiting.
   root@nuc2:~# resize2fs /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
   resize2fs 1.46.5 (30-Dec-2021)
   Filesystem at /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv is mounted on /; on-line resizing required
   old_desc_blocks = 13, new_desc_blocks = 233
   The filesystem on /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv is now 487577600 (4k) blocks long.
   ```

## Stand-up Vanilla NUCs

Once all the NUCs are raw, as per these steps, run this command on your local
computer:

If you didn't change the user/password, edit the host names below and run:

```bash
apb Hosts/standup-vanilla.yml -e "rawhosts=nuc1,nuc2 nameservers=10.1.0.1,1.1.1.1 timezone=EST"
```

If you did change the user and password, edit the hostnames, user, and password
below and run:

```bash
apb Hosts/standup-vanilla.yml -e "rawhosts=nuc1,nuc2 user=newUser pass=newPassword nameservers=10.1.0.1,1.1.1.1 timezone=EST"
```

Passing in a `nameserver` is optional, if you do not pass one in, `1.1.1.1` will
be used. Likewise with `timezone`, default is `US/Pacific`

If there are no failures, all raw NUC's are now vanilla hosts üôå

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="3">

## Stand-up Vanilla Generic Device

Given the setup for Raspberry Pis and NUCs, we should now have some guidelines
on setting up a _generic_ device. Be sure to read the NUC setup steps in
particular.

Of first importance is to make sure the device meets _hardware_ requirements
outlined [elsewhere](/docs/l1-hosts/hardware). With that set, the easiest way
forward is to start with Ubuntu server, as it will be generally the most
well-supported among a variety of hardware. What is more, with Ubuntu, getting
it into a raw state shouldn't be dissimilar from setting up a NUC as we have
just seen.

Here are some basic goalposts for adding a generic host that we should call
attention to from the NUC guide.

- [ ] Name the host uniquely in accordance with your naming plan.
- [ ] Get ssh access from your control machine via password
- [ ] Make sure `hostnamectl` is set correctly.
- [ ] Make sure Ansible does not need to enter the password to use root
      privileges by adding `hab ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL`
- [ ] Make sure the disk partition is as big as it can be

All of these have pathways in the NUC guide above, in fact, again, most of the
NUC guide should apply.

You can then stand up a vanilla generic raw host using the same command we have
already seen:

```bash
apb Hosts/standup-vanilla.yml -e "rawhosts=geriatric1"
```

If there are no failures, all raw generic hosts are now vanilla hosts üôå

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you don't have any other computers, you can proceed to the section below.
Otherwise, change the tab above to the next set of hosts.
