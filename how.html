article), which is what Kubernetes (k8s) does. There are many good technical
introductions to this, so if you are already deeply familiar with programming
and computers, we suggest this one from
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/container-orchestration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IBM</a>.</p><p>That said, CO is a fairly niche concept. Many of the explanations of CO or
Kubernetes do not approach the topic from first principles, either assuming deep
knowledge of how computers work (e.g. the explainer is intended for
long-established technical experts learning a new niche) or, on the contrary,
they do not have a wide enough understanding of the topic to <em>also</em> explain or
include the <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> of the problem they solve in a relatable way (e.g.
&quot;Here&#x27;s how to build a k8s cluster, to solve the problem of being not as hip as
you could be&quot;).</p><p>In this explainer, we hope to avoid both of these pitfalls.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="turing">Turing<a class="hash-link" href="#turing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Let&#x27;s start with something that exists in reality, that everyone should be
familiar with, a cat:
<img loading="lazy" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Felis_catus-cat_on_snow.jpg" alt="Cat" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Now, let&#x27;s consider something else that exists in reality, a
computer:<img loading="lazy" src="https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pictures/160000/velka/ordinateur-de-bureau-pc-1456070535WEH.jpg" alt="https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pictures/160000/velka/ordinateur-de-bureau-pc-1456070535WEH.jpg" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Where do these two things overlap?</p><p>Well, for starters, the cat has the ability to see and recognize symbols, say,
of another cat. As such, it has a symbol of what a cat looks like in its mind.
We humans have this ability too, we have a symbol (albeit imperfect) of a cat,
or another human, or a computer in our head which allows us to recognize what we
are looking at. Indeed, for humans it goes far deeper than this and than cats; a
human who knows another human sufficiently well, can simulate with decent enough
accuracy what that other person would think, say, or do, given a certain premise
(for more on this see the book,
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123471.I_Am_a_Strange_Loop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I am a Strange Loop by Douglas Hofstadter</a>).</p><p>Now, let&#x27;s consider what the computer &quot;thinks&quot;: a computer, too can think of a
computer, but not in the same way that a cat or a human think of themselves. It
has a unique property in that it can, inside itself, simulate how another
computer thinks. And this is important: it need not be a <em>symbol</em> at all, it can
be a fully functioning computer, and it can be completely indistinguishable from
itself: an <em>exact</em> copy.</p><p>Without diving into the nuance, this ability is achievable by any computer in
the class of computers known as Turning Complete, as defined by Alan
Turning.<img loading="lazy" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Turing_Machine_Model_Davey_2012.jpg" alt="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Turing_Machine_Model_Davey_2012.jpg" class="img_ev3q">
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Turing_Machine_Model_Davey_2012.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A basic Turing Machine</a></p><p>Nearly all computers which can perform the simple functions of store data, read
data, and change data can do this. Even the originally conceived Turing Machine
shown above. Yes, given enough tape, it can simulate a <em>MacBook</em> as they are
both Turing Complete. This is a very powerful concept:</p><blockquote><p>A Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation describing an abstract
machine that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of
rules. Despite the model&#x27;s simplicity, it is capable of implementing any
computer algorithm. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a></p></blockquote><p>It is so powerful it can emulate entire computers which emulate computers which
emulate computers, recursively forever (in theory, of course, in practice memory
always runs out). Which is to say, given enough tape, the above tape based
Turning Machine can emulate a MacBook which is emulating a tap computer, which
is emulating a MacBook... well, you get the idea.</p><p>The best visual example of this, of course, is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conway&#x27;s Game of Life</a>,
a single player game that has the unique quality of also being Turing Complete,
it can emulate itself (given an infinite playing board):</p><iframe width="100%" height="400vh" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4lO0iZDzzXk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>Computers are good at many things like word processing, social media, or playing
games, but many of these uses do not employ the computers&#x27; ability to simulate
itself. In fact, very little, historically speaking, of any consumer use cases
rely on simulating other computers. And rightly so, there is by and large
fundamentally no need to nest computers... emulation mostly exists as a cool, if
not a bit weird, possibility in computing.</p><p>That was, until Docker came onto the scene in 2013, and put this on its head
with one very big use case: Containerization.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="containerization">Containerization<a class="hash-link" href="#containerization" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Containers, as it turns out, are <em>extremely</em> useful in attempting to solve
problems of
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzf9LD1unTk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resource isolation and application packaging</a>.
It is very easy to assign resources to a virtual computer that will never be
exceeded when the computer has no way of knowing there are more resources to
use—like one level of the game of life being unaware of any which supports it.
What is more, packaging an application is much easier and more reliable when all
the dependencies all the way down to the OS can be included. Further, this has
added benefits for security: one container can only communicate with another
container via network routing despite living on the same physical memory chips.
To this end, entire extremely secure OSes are built where
<a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">each app is a VM</a>.</p><p>What is more, a container that has these defined resources can also have defined
initialization steps. For instance, to set up a new server, generally, you would
need to install the OS, set users, set passwords, apply security measures,
update, and add services to get the box into a working state. When the box
itself is a virtual computer, you can begin to automate, remove, or simplify
steps, grouping similar work flows into what are now called &quot;images&quot;—an &quot;image&quot;
of a computer that is set up a particular way. If you want a container that will
host a website written in JavaScript, you might consider using any one of the
NodeJS images, which are fully optimized to run NodeJs scripts, adding a few
build steps to serve the website, and then saving that image. The upshot being,
if you want to replicate the container running that image, all the processes
which need to run to do so, are fully defined, easily sharable, and thus all the
difficulties of running the software are already overcome.</p><p><a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker</a>, in 2013, was the first to market that did all
the above, and a bit more, to make containerization an easy-to-use development
and operations tool. It changed the way people thought about virtualizing
computers. And consequently, it began to show where new help was now needed:
when all your apps and services were running in containers, organizing,
automating, scaling, and monitoring those containers became paramount.</p><p>Enter, orchestration.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="orchestration">Orchestration<a class="hash-link" href="#orchestration" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Though many companies have worked through these issues as well, Google,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsFDp-W1Ks0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">perhaps</a>, has the longest history
and experience with orchestrating both physical machines and virtual ones.
Google launched it&#x27;s first production server on cheap, expecting to fail,
consumer hardware using custom fault-tolerant software.</p><p>Eventually, that idea became an internal tool called
&quot;<a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43438/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Borg</a>&quot;.</p><p>It solved problems like:</p><ul><li>Making sure a container is healthy</li><li>Making sure there are the right number of healthy containers</li><li>Making sure these containers can talk to each other</li><li>Making sure they are located on appropriate physical machines</li><li>Making sure certain jobs run at certain times</li><li>Etc</li></ul><p>Borg was (<em>is</em>) the &quot;secret sauce&quot; for Google, and it is how Google delivered
all of its applicable products as highly fault-tolerant and scalable. This
became the backdrop of what is now Kubernetes, a free and open source,
orchestration tool for containers.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="kubernetes">Kubernetes<a class="hash-link" href="#kubernetes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>To put some scale on how incredible k8s is, one of the unique problems that
Kubernetes solves is scaling: adding more servers to a deployment as more
resources are demanded, or, conversely, scaling down servers as less resources
are needed. It does this by measuring how many hits a server might be getting
and then adjusting the number of containers that would service those hits. 100
hits per second might only need 2 containers, while a million hits per second
might need 10,000. A properly configured Kubernetes setup, would be able to
seamlessly, and without a hiccup, spin up any number of new servers according to
whatever the demand was.</p><p>These numbers are not exaggerations. Attached are two great example of how
powerful k8s is. This is k8s scaling up servers in a server farm — and then
rolling out an update while maintaining steady latency and no downtime. To be
clear, when the narrator says &quot;servers&quot; he is referring to containers. However,
let not the magic of Kubernetes be lost on anyone: when you watch these videos
try to imagine spinning up the stated number of <em>physical computers</em> in <em>any</em>
amount of time. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TOWLerX0Ps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wow,</a> and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C6YeyyUUmI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">double wow</a>.</p><p>Kubernetes is tremendously powerful and important. In fact, we&#x27;d wager that it
is in the top 5 most important pieces of software written in the last 20 years
(along with Bitcoin and a short list of others). In summary, Kubernetes allows
you to coordinate <em>any set of computers</em> into one single cluster—and those
computers can live anywhere on <em>earth</em> with an internet connection. Kubernetes
is <em>software</em> that makes applications <em>physical-reality-agnostic</em>. It allows for
hardware to completely fail, while keeping the <em>software</em> still running.</p><p>Kubernetes is now the international standard for handling these problems and is
responsible for trillions in value as it supports large swaths of the legacy
internet. The Kubernetes landscape is
<a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/card-mode?grouping=no&amp;sort=amount" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">presently funded</a>
by a staggering $56 Billion.</p><p>Which brings us to the new internet, the peer internet, and Bitcoin.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="bitcoin-on-a-highly-available-node">Bitcoin on a Highly Available Node<a class="hash-link" href="#bitcoin-on-a-highly-available-node" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Collectively, CO services like Kubernetes, in solving many of the problems just
listed, become what is known as Highly Available (or High Availability): they
are very unlikely to go down under all kinds of different stress. This is where
we get the name <em>HA Bitcoin Node</em>.</p><p>In broad strokes, a HAB Node is set up and works like this:</p><ol><li>A few bitcoin node-capable computers are networked together (they become a
&quot;cluster&quot;).</li><li>They are then provisioned with Kubernetes, and their resources are cataloged,
and health checked.</li><li>Many implementations and versions of Bitcoin are made into images.</li><li>Those images are then chosen, according to operator preference and
availability, to be used in containers on the various hosts.</li><li>That &quot;plan&quot; is given to Kubernetes, and k8s looks at its health and
availability of its resources and does what it thinks is best in deploying
that plan and keeping to that plan.</li><li>If resources are degraded, it attempts to &quot;move&quot; the bitcoin container(s)
away from the degraded resource and towards the healthy ones.</li></ol><p>This setup allows for dynamic and fault-tolerant node operating scenarios.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="scenario-1">Scenario 1<a class="hash-link" href="#scenario-1" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In an obvious example, where we are vastly reducing the complexity of what is
actually happening, let&#x27;s say there are two host computers in the cluster. Both
are local machines. The plan is such that, on each of the local machines, a
bitcoin container and a lightning container runs, each with a full copy of the
blockchain networked together (Fig. 1).</p><p>For all Figures, ↔ represent a peer-to-peer connection and → represent a
dependency connection, and ... is a broken connection. Let&#x27;s see how various
entities in the cluster can fail, yet the cluster remain available:</p><p>Fig. 1. Healthy two host HAB Node</p><p>Fig. 2. HAB Node with failed Bitcoin Node 1</p><p>Fig. 3. HAB Node with failed Lightning Node 1</p><p>Fig. 4. HAB Node with failed Lightning Node 1, and failed Bitcoin Node 2</p><p>Fig. 5. HAB Node with failed Computer 1</p><p>As you can see, the node can remain fully operational under a myriad of degraded
conditions. In fact, we can think of the above node as a 1-of-2 schema, not
dissimilar from a 1-of-2 multi-sig wallet. And this functionality dramatically
improves with more hosts added. However, we should note that this example is
primarily a static routing example, a lot more interesting options are possible
in a HAB Node, including self-healing.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="scenario-2">Scenario 2<a class="hash-link" href="#scenario-2" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In a more advanced example (but again with dramatic reductions in complexity),
let&#x27;s say there are three host computers in the cluster. Of the three hosts, one
is a remote cloud server, and two are local machines. The plan is such that, on
each of the local machines, a bitcoin container with a full copy of the
blockchain and a Lightning container are running. The remote machine in the
cloud acts as compute backup, or N+1. Nothing runs on that node unless there is
an emergency, making it much cheaper to operate month to month.</p><p>Fig. 6, Healthy three Host HAB Node</p><p>To demonstrate the robustness of this model, let&#x27;s now assume, in Figure 7, one
of the host machines, Computer 1, has unknown issues:</p><p>Fig. 7, Three Host HAB Node where one host fails</p><p>Kubernetes detects that there is service degradation on one of the bitcoin nodes
and/or hosts. It then notes which image is running there and starts a new
container on the third host computer with that same image, networks the
container (and new node) with its local peer, and begins to sync the blockchain.</p><p>Fig. 8, Three Host HAB Node where one host fails, but the cluster recovered full
redundancy, sans N+1</p><p>During this failure event, the node operator has no downtime with respect to
both the Bitcoin network and the Lightning network. As such, all higher level
self-hosted services which rely on high local bitcoin uptime remain unaffected.
Once the blockchain is synced, 2x redundancy is restored. Incredibly, k8s can
even go further than this. Though it may take some custom hardware or scripting,
k8s could even trigger a power cycle on the problematic host given the
appropriate amount of failed health checks.</p><p>The above would happen in real time, as an automated process, and alerting could
be forwarded so that the operator can then troubleshoot the problematic host
when available or if even needed, as opposed to <strong><em>we are actively losing income
fix immediately</em></strong>. Once the host is back up, Kubernetes will start a bitcoin
node on Computer 1 and once synced, remove the Bitcoin node from the cloud, to
fully remediate the incident.</p><p>You should recognize the above process as one similar to (but distinctly
different from) a different kind of multi-signature transaction: m-of-3. In the
case of a 1-of-3 wallet where up to two of the keys can be lost, yet the wallet
retains signing capabilities, we see a parallel in that 2 hosts can be down, and
we still have a working node. It is also similar to a 2-of-3 wallet where we
control two of the three keys, and a custodian controls the third. That model
has a parallel in that running a host in the cloud provides us more assurances
with our node that are hard to attain otherwise, like geographic diversity.</p><p>You will notice this model also cuts on different verticals to prevent downtime.
If we diversify Bitcoin implementations, and diversify Lightning
implementations, and, say, one implementation becomes unstable, the others can
then carry the uptime forward.</p><p>But let&#x27;s not gloss over the bigger picture either: Computer : Cluster :: Node :
Bitcoin Network. What Kubernetes does for uptime is the <em>very same</em> (but weaker)
paradigm that bitcoin the network at large does, with the added functionality of
also centrally controlling the <em>entire</em> network of computers. Thankfully, the
bitcoin network doesn&#x27;t have this functionality because that is a <em>feature</em>. To
put a Copernican Shift on it... it took the legacy tech paradigm decades,
billions of dollars of investment, and millions of hours of developer time to
achieve an imperfect, albeit incredibly powerful solution to availability.
Whereas Satoshi with a few years of thought, writing, and coding created the
<em>ideal</em> solution to availability in a distributed system.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="hash-link" href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As you can imagine, failure cases, host counts, host types, N+x, and a slew of
other strategies and tactics can provide unlimited scenarios to demonstrate the
capabilities and power of CO as a means of providing highly available
architecture. Indeed, the two scenarios presented here only scratch the surface.
But this is the simplified version of how a HAB Node works.</p><p>To bring the second scenario all the way back to how we first introduced
virtualization, this explanation applies directly to what a HAB Node does:</p><blockquote><p>A computer is thinking of another computer. The computer it is thinking of
crashes. Thankfully, it was just a thought, so the computer thinks up another
computer to replace it and carries on.</p></blockquote><p>Only it&#x27;s for a bitcoin node. It is, without metaphor, this:</p><blockquote><p>My cluster is running bitcoin node containers. One node it is running crashes.
Thankfully, it was just a container, so my cluster spins up another container
to replace it and carries on.</p></blockquote><p>The idea of virtualizing opened up new horizons for cloud computing. Now, it
opens up new horizons for Bitcoin and the peer to peer internet. With the
realization of HAB Nodes, we can apply billions of investment in CO underneath
and in support of the ideal bitcoin peer-to-peer solution to uptime by attaching
those solutions to the individual bitcoin node.</p><hr><p>To begin building your own HAB Node, read the Introduction to the
